Constructors

Any denpencies needed for the class go in the parenteses of the constructor.
Angular 2 will create an instance object of whatever is included here (services etc)
Variables included here will created and initialised.

So the following says, create an instance of 'Object', called '_varName'. And since it is private, it will only be accessible within this class.

private _varName: Object
